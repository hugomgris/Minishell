# Minishell

REMEMBER TO SWITCH BRANCHES BEFORE WORKING ON ANY FEATURE

Naming conv, if agreed: name every function starting with ms_ (example: ms_input_check.c).

Pull request conv, i agreed: we can check the checklists of the project sections while doing them before the pull request, and leave the general checkbox (the one numbered, often with x.x.x.x format) to be checked after branch test and merging.

Optional to-do: test dependency implementations
	-.d files?
	- libft & printf dependencies on main Makefile (i.e., minishell compilation).
