# Minishell

125/125

We almost died in the process, but we did it. 

This is Nico's (/mrlouf) and my minishell build, done with both Bash and ZSH as reference. To compile it, just make from root directory and execute ./minishell. We also wrote a script that installs minishell in the system, using a symlink to the binary built by the makefile, so that minishell can be run anywhere (similar as any other installed shell). 

All the features detailed in the subject, including mandatory and bonus sections, are included in our project. We also added some extra features, like a complex custom prompt, extra features for the cd command and error redirections. 

For anything else, check the documentation folder :D
