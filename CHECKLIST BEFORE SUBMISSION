TODO before submitting Minishell:

+++ REMOVE +++

- Remove any printf/ft_printf/cucufu that is not necessary (that was used for debug)
- Remove unnecessary functions from minishell.h?
- Remove any test file, script, text file, infile, outfile, whatever, from the main directory. Any thing that is not necessary for defense must be deleted.
- Comment the -g -fsanitize=address flags from the Makefile (uncomment them during the defence with the evaluator)

+++ TEST +++

- Simulate tests in 'real' condition: try and follow the correction sheet and see what happens > SEGFAULT? Bad free? Leak?
- If something does not behave exactly like bash > can we explain why or why not? Friendly reminder: Minishell is not bash
- Try and mix tests, like echo with a wildcard, parenthesis with builtins, etc.

+++ GIT REPO +++

- Make sure the whole local repo is clean.
- Make.
- Sure.
- It.
- Is.

- Everything okay? Norminette too?
- Double check and double check again.
